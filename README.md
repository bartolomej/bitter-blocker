## System Overview

We've developed a browser extension that can interact with the user's social media websites.

For starters, we only support Twitter, but we could easily extend our solution to other platforms like Facebook, etc.

Our browser extensions communicates with our backend server, which in turn interacts with a NLP (Natural Language Processing) tool of choice (we currently support [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) and [OpenAI GPT3](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/)).
